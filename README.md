# Quantum Positioning System (QPS)

## Overview

The Quantum Positioning System (QPS) is an innovative approach to positioning technology, utilizing principles of quantum mechanics, quantum entanglement, and string theory to create a system capable of faster-than-light information transfer and positioning. The framework leverages the capabilities of Python and the Qiskit library to simulate quantum interactions and develop a new frontier for positioning systems.

### Theories and Conceptualization
**Theories proposed by Kiruthik.**

This system operates on the idea that quantum entanglement, string interactions, and higher-dimensional fields contribute directly to positioning data, allowing for more accurate and faster data transfer than classical systems like GPS. Theoretical constructs like **Quantum Frequency Mapping**, **String Interactions**, and **Higher Dimensional Fields** are utilized to provide mass and positional information.
